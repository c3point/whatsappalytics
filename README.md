# whatsappalytics


## Summary
This is a toolkit to analyse whatsapp chats. Used in a notebook it can produce a nice report of one of your chats.
Not that this is still under development so more functionality will be added and it could still be prone to errors.
The base files which are used by this toolkit are exported whatsapp chats in .txt format without sent media

## Issues
I don't know which kind of formats of exported whatsapp chats exist, so for now this only works for the following format:
15.04.18, 20:43 - <Name1>: <text of message...>
19.04.18, 21:51 - <Name2>: <text of message...>
              ......
But other formats could be easily added as soon as i get confrontated with them. 
  
## Example 
Here you can see an example output of the toolkit used in a jupyter-notebook
